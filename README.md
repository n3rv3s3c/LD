# LD
C++ CODE

In this example, the position data is being loaded from a file called "position.txt" using an ifstream object. 
The getline function is used to read the first line of the file and store it in the position variable.

The position is then passed as an argument to the execl function,
which replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the given path. 

The child process will run the specified executable file and pass the position as an argument.
The parent process will wait until the child process terminates with wait(NULL).

Note that this is a simple example and you might need to modify it based on your requirements, such as the path to the executable and the format of the position data.
